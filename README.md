# NADBenchmarks 

NADBenchmarks is a website aimed at facilitating search for benchmark datasets for Machine Learning for Natural Disasters, produced by ROCHCI. This is an early version, consisting of only benchmark datasets for natural disasters, categorizing the papers according to the disaster management cycle. In the future, we intend on making a more comprehensive site, with more functionalities.
